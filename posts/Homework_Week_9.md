### The Psychology if Creative Processes in Nusic, by Eric Fillenz Clarke (2020)

"Like Ingolds favoured imahe of a fungal mycelium (Ingold 2003), creatice prcciesses goriw out into their environment with untraceavle fin spun ramification, drawing sustenance from their environment even as they constiture and change it."
- **Ingold, Tim. 2003.** "Two Refelections on Ecological Knowledge." In Nature KNowledge: Enthoscience, Cognition, Identity, edited by Glauco Sanga and Gherardo Ortalli

Theory of Affordance: The embodied and instrumental and technologicsl components can be understood in terms of the theory of affordances, outlined by the psuchologist James Gibson (1966, 1979)

### Biomimicry

This is where humans take inspirtation of how to do something from the natural world. The natural world has solved problems in material design, where evolution has already solved complex problems, This is what mycelial creativity is. We as designers, mimic or apply that knowledge to our own creative practice. It is often not seen in many creative domains, however, there is an urgency to learn from nature.

###Mycelial Praxis
- **Omnidirectional:** does not respect geographic/cultural/socio-economical/disciplinary divisions. This is the process of growing outwards.
- **Accumalitive:** creative capacity increases incrementally. They are specific, yet there are may of them that constitutes a relationship. From one thing can stem into many other relationships. This is a slow process, and that is simply okay. It is the matter of putting down mycelia. Gradually, it will accumulate and grow. This is the knowledge that we buildthrough this process.
- **Transformational:** we are shaped by what the environment has to offer, whilst at the same time we shape the environment. There is also the potential to decompose material rejected by other systems. kas...K

## Repertoire
We have the shared experience of taking care of them, the fun parts and difficult parts.

## Shared Values
Playing with and entertaining our rabbits.

## Brokering
sharing these experiences, tips, and knowledge we have learnt when needed.

what colours can rabbits see and what frequency of sound can they hear (screen record research - add that into the video essay.)
