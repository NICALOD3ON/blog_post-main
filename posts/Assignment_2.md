### Introduction 
This first creative coding assignment requres us to explore the conventions of a 'Cute!' creative genre in p5. However, this first poses the question of: what makes a creative coding piece 'Cute'? This is something I hope to explore and iterate on upon further research and implementation of practice. I will also look to the works of artists such as RafaÃ«l Rozendaal and course content to build my knowledge further.

### Reading Sianne Ngai - Zany, Cute, Interesting (Wark 2020)
The aesthetic idea of the 'zany' is a performative aesthetic that is 'hot and sweaty, anxious [and] excessive' (Ngai, 2020. 5). The author continues to define the aesthetic qualities of 'zany' as a feel for 'instability', or perhaps even an act of 'desperation' or 'stress'. The aesthetic itself is 'precarious' and 'forced', 'sexy' but not 'joyous' (Ngai, 7).

When I interpret this into my own words, I see the 'zany' easthetic as one that is barely containing itself. As if a 'digital body' were about to explode. I want to experiment creatively to represent what that looks like - what it feels like. How can I create texture? What kind of texture am I even looking for? These are the questions I have set for myself that I want to find the answer to.
