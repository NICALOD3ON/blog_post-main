### Brainstorming
Create a video between 3-5 minutes.

I know that for my assignment, I want to focus my community of practice around the niche interest and passion for rabbits as domestic pets. However, I ask myself the question: "How and CAN I do this?". At this point, I was already feelings a lot of doubt -- I wasn't sure on what to do or how to do it and I immediately felt lost. I knew I had a passion for this topic, but what about it is driving me?

After lots of consideration and deep thought, I realised why I grew to love what I love so much. I wanted to bring awareness to the beautiful bond and companionship a human can have with a bunny, because I know it is sometimes doubted: "How nice can a rabbit be? THey don't even talk or play!". I know this is thought by some because I used to think the exact same, but ever since I had adopted my two bunnies, I had grown to love them like any other sweet being on earth.

### Speak About Sianne Ngai's 'Zany, Cute, Interesting'

In Ngai’s ‘Zany, Cute, Interesting’, the author describes the aesthetic as something that opens up conversation – sparked through curiosity and wonder. The aesthetic interesting has an affect to desire more – to know more.  when something is interesting, we invite conversation. 'It “begins with a feeling — inquisitiveness, curiosity, wonder — an affect and a desire.” It addresses  a world of sped up information,  asking for slowed down attention. It is an "art".

### Communities of Practice

It is a structure that allows us to learn, grow, and develop skills together within the practice. This community can be as simple as ones home, a classroom, or a group of friends with niche interests! My community of practice will be centered around those who are close to me that love our pet rabbits!  Like my friends, online groups, and my own family!

### Domain of Interest

If you couldn’t tell, my domain of interest for this project will be my bunnies and domesticated bunnies in general.

### Repetoire

In this community, our repertoire is to express how rabbits make excellent companions and sweet little friends! This then lines us up with our ‘shared values’.

### Shared Values

The values we share in this community are that whilst rabbits aren’t easy pets, they are not boring! At all! They are full of personality, however, people may not seem to agree as rabbits don’t communicate vocally the way cats and dogs do.

### Brokering

Therefore, I want to broker these values and experiences from my community of practice to another, by creating a playful  way of communication between rabbits and humans.


###Mycelial Praxis
- **Omnidirectional:** does not respect geographic/cultural/socio-economical/disciplinary divisions. This is the process of growing outwards -- aking the opportunities to learn, even if that means branching out your research like looking at articles, images, or reaching out to your community
- **Accumalitive:** creative capacity increases incrementally. They are specific, yet there are may of them that constitutes a relationship. From one thing can stem into many other relationships. This is a slow process, and that is simply okay. It is the matter of putting down mycelia. Gradually, it will accumulate and grow. This is the knowledge that we buildthrough this process.
- **Transformational:** we are shaped by what the environment has to offer, whilst at the same time we shape the environment. There is also the potential to decompose material rejected by other systems.
