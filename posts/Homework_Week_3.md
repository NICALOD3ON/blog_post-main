Before I begin with the documentation of Homework Week 3, I will first document my notes from todays session in my own words and understanding.

**Effective Complexity**
What is generative art? Generative art is made form algorithms. If we are able to control these processes, we can create something artistic through a designer perspective. As creative people, we look to these algorithms as a sense of affectiveness.

- non-randomness (coherance) x non-redundancy (spiciness)
- things are the same yet a bit different from eachother
- when looking at the artwork as a whole, you experience a
- resonating feeling with the work, admiring the complexity

**Dassif resurrections 4: Lissajous study** Each of the curves are similar but slightly different. The pink lines have a sense of cohesion in direction and movement, until the end of the note where they become sparatic, creating a sense of chaos withing the work.

**Deep Sadness (Rafael Rozendal)** The artist utilises randomness in this work. Through the frequency of the different few second notes and subtle chaotic change.

**Cuteness:** This requires a balance between coherance and a little bit of chaos. This brings about a feeling of interest within an aesthetic composition of work.

the meaning of **pos** in p5 is position, and **vel** means velocity.

**PI** would talk about a circle

**vel.rotate (PI / number value)** spin around in circle, number value determines the circumference

**acc** would refer to acceleration
